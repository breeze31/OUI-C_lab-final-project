the project is to creater an assambler in C with a few constrains and printout output files if source input is valid otherwise it print an error message
use this as a reffereance for future project, i got a perfect socre for this project but its not perfect one of the requirements was that we check that a MACRO wasnt use as a label and i havent implamented it
